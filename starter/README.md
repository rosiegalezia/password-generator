# password-generator
A password generator tool created for Bootcamp week 5 challenge

## Description

This is a JavaScript project to generate a password based on a user's requirements, i.e. length and types of characters to be included in the password. The code takes five inputs from the user and stores them to meet their needs, as well as including error messages for if the user provides an invalid input (e.g. entering a value that is not a number for password length, or not selecting any character types).

It uses four arrays containing different character types (lowercase, uppercase, special characters and numbers), and generates a secure password from these to meet the user's needs. 

The project was a good opportunity to further the JavaScript skills learnt in Week 5 of the Front-End Web Development bootcamp and further my logical thinking to solve problems using code. 

Completing the challenge required the creation of several functions, use of objects, if...else loops and application of new functions such as math.random and NaN. Pseudocoding the challenge before beginning the JS was incredibly helpful as it allowed the code to be broken down into more manageable, code-able 'chunks' that made the challenge less overwhelming.
